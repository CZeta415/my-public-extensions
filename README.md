# 🚀 Public Extensions

Welcome to my personal collection of browser extensions (Chrome, Thorium, Brave, Edge, etc.). Here I will publish various tools that are useful for both me and you, ranging from simple tweaks to massive optimizations or completely new designs.

**Why?** Because I got sick of snail-paced websites. 🐌❌
